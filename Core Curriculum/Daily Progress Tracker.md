#### 15/08 - Piscine ends 

## Sept, Oct, Nov (Waiting Period):
- Therapy

## Mid-Nov
### W1
#### 17/11 (Mon 1): Orientation, nearly got TIG’d for coffee :’)
#### 18/11 (Tues 2): Sick
#### 19/11 (Wed 3): Sick + Doc’s Appt + Family stuff
#### 20/11 (Thurs 4): Sick
#### 20/11 (Fri 5): Went school late (Still Sick)
#### 22/11 (WkEnd, Sat 6) WFH (Still Sick):
- Set up working environment (iPad + Keyboard + “Working Copy” IDE/ Application for Git Versioning).
- ChatGPT “refined” Post-piscine custom project instructions for “Computer Science” folder/ project
- Admin (SUTD email, slack, etc…)
- Therapy
#### 23/11 (WkEnd, Sun 7) WFH (Still Sick):
- Continue setting up working environment (ChatGPT custom instructions to fit 42 A.I. pedagogy).
            
### W2

#### 24/11 (Mon 8):
- Join Run Club as Core first time
- Added zsh setup guide for curproj (cd to cur. proj. + Check git status), 
- Also zsh setup guide for syncproj (copy cur. proj to public GitHub - THIS - and git push), 
- Synced folder libft.
#### 25/11 (Tues 9):
- Reported to campus without sleep, even after Track (10*400M) intervals...
- (Previous day is 8 hours of sleep after a night before that of skipping sleep again)
- Studied requirements of Libft (PDF).
- Careful “re-solidifying” of C fundamentals/ Piscine contents.
- Started libft/isalpha
- Learnt itoa, 5 algos (simple, -ve trick, efficient, hardcoding, theoretical/ cute/dumb i.e. recursion)
#### 26/11 (Wed 10):
- (Malloc, char**) “re-solidifying” of C fundamentals/ Piscine contents
- Alex senior taught 7 bitwise operations (^ XOR, |, &, ~ inversion, ! NOT, << bit shift, >>)
- Learnt file descriptors (fd), and how UNIX represents things as “files”
- write(fd), where 1 (stdout) and 2 (stderr) both point to terminal, but 1 can be piped to file.
- How ft_putchar_fd is deceptively simple (need test edge cases but don’t go too extreme than libc)
- Alex corrected ft_putchar_fd‘s char c requires addressing (in hindsight, duh!)
- Alex also taught how bitwise can be used for comparison (isprintable, iseven in isdigit…)
- Alex also explained why HIS IMPLEMENTATION isdigit functions returns in powers of 2 (helps bitwise comparison).
- But apparently ChatGPT says that’s secretly cursed because powers of 2 is internal, guaranteed returns are 0, 1.
- Alex however (anyway) advised for purpose of libft, we “don’t have to go until so complicated”, i.e. return 1,0 good enough.
- Ran 2.95KM to end-of-PIE Plane Spotting area with the gang!
#### 27/11 (Thurs 11):
- Made Study Notes.md, something I should have started long ago w. ChatGPT learning
- Inspiration from alleow's notes.txt
- Learnt a lot about structs and enums today (and using them together for simple reading).
- Learnt (side-track) what "computation" even is (and alternative computation models); how can one not know what they're learning?
- Computation: At its barest bones, computation means performing a rule-governed transformation of information.
-	A system is computing when:
	1. You can describe its state.
	2. You can describe a rule for evolving that state.
	3. The rule produces reproducible outputs.
- Learnt LUTs (look-up tables). And how isdigit() can be mapped to ASCII, cast as unsigned char to index LUT, written as such giving O(1).
- Learnt LUTs' space-time trade off (faster but heavier; more speed, but more memory)
- Learnt (roughly) how bitwise code is supposed to be written properly, not abused (i.e. Libft)
- How to check diff in git repo. (synced?)

```
git fetch
git status
git diff HEAD..origin/main
```

#### 28/11 (Fri 12):
- Went to campus just for 15 mins. 
- Tried fixing study notes broken link. Undone. 
#### 29/11 (WkEnd, Sat 13):
- Out of campus, repair glasses and family birthday celebration. 
#### 30/11 (WkEnd, Sun 14):
- Out of campus (Charity event, Run For Rice 3.0, volunteer.give.asia/activity/run-for-rice-3)

## Dec
### W3
#### 01/12 (Mon 15):
- Urgent wisdom tooth extraction, suffered for 2 days straight afterwards. (Bleeding complications)
#### 02/12 (Tues 16):
- Complete resting due to wisdom tooth.
- Midnight revision on whether we can have a “sentinel struct linked list”
