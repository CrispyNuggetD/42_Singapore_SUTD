# My 42 Plan

I was stressing out during first day orientation as everyone wanted to compete for Core graduation speed leaderboard.

But I realised while that’s fun and challenging (being competitive), it doesn’t and shouldn’t apply to me because I’m concurrently juggling therapy and trying to maintain inner balance anyway. (Last thing I want is a relapse, leading to a Freeze!).

So I opted for the 12 months track that recommends, 35-45 hours a week, which I will have to study on weekends too. However, for my challenges, I probably have an (at least) “1.5x Multiplier Bonus Effect”, needing 60+ hours to get the same amount of work done.

# 42 Tips for others if you chance upon my repo.

Get an iPad if you can, with a keyboard. It's like having a Macbook/ MacOS but you can poke the screen too (and more)!

Then set up working environment by downloading “Working Copy” IDE/ Application for Git Versioning. Costs $40 (SGD, 2025) to do Git Push but it’s a necessary evil I guess. But hey, it’s a good app and Anders has to eat too! And it’s a good study investment.

Having an Apple Pencil is a neat bonus (Direct annotation + Note-taking/ Apple’s “Freeform” App for creative brainstorming canvas). But otherwise keep a Personal Notebook or just have Pen + Paper with you always like I also do (Batteries also die. And sometimes iPad just doesn’t apply). 

That being said, it’s always easier to sketch out ideas to think of a solution to the problem. Use whiteboards if needed when discussing with peers. Or just scribble and talk with yourself at the whiteboards. (That’s probably okay too, I guess).
